# Who Am I

_Blog in CN, the rest in EN._

Hey there, my name is Sylvan. I work as a software engineer in an ecommerce company, at Beijing, China. I am building this website only for posting my daily thoughts and my study notes of interesting technologies.

One might ask why the heck do I call myself Sylvan. The reason sounds a little bit naive because the inspiration came from one of my favorite heroine, whose name is [Sylvanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvanas_Windrunner), in a video game called World of Warcraft. Originally, sylvan comes from a Latin word silva which means ‘a wood’. This is where I really admire the designers of this game in that the name Sylvanas perfectly embodies who the female elf is and where she is from. Sylvanas is a courageous elf ranger who once lived in a tranquil and spectacular forest called Eversong Woods and sacrificed her life there. I know the thought might sound crazy but I really wish I could live in such a place one day, despite that it is totally fabricated by game programmers.
