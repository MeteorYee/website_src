## From Unix Pipeline to Lambda Architecture
Unix pipeline is a simple but elegant way to make multiple processes conmunicate with each other. Each process only observes to a basic principle, do one thing well, but if they work in a row, being chained together by the pipleline mechanism, many complicated tasks can be accomplished. For example, we can readily do some statistical analysis upon the log files of a software using cat, grep, awk, sort, uniq.

## The Big OS for a Modern Company
The companies nowadays are more or less digitalized. Therefore, there must be some operating system in a way running for their daily businesses. In other words, the tens of thousands of computers of a company, except for those donâ€™t use computers at all, should work in an organized way in order to make profits, just like there are many processes running in a computer OS.

A basic business pattern could be, at first, customers produces their transactional data by getting in touch with the company's products in any ways, such as browsing online, visiting a brick-and-mortar store and making a purchase etc.
